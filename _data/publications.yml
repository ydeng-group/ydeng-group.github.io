  title: Enhancing severe hypoglycemia prediction in type 2 diabetes mellitus through multi-view co-training machine learning model for imbalanced dataset

  abstract: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have severe hypoglycemia (SH) poses a considerable risk of long-term death, especially among the elderly, demanding urgent medical attention. Accurate prediction of SH remains challenging due to its multifaced nature, contributed from factors such as medications, lifestyle choices, and metabolic measurements. In this study, we propose a systematic approach to improve the robustness and accuracy of SH predictions using machine learning models, guided by clinical feature selection. Our focus is on developing long-term SH prediction models using both semi-supervised learning and supervised learning algorithms. Using the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes trial, which includes electronic health records for over 10,000 individuals, we focus on studying adults with T2DM. Our results indicate that the application of a multi-view co-training method, incorporating the random forest algorithm, improves the specificity of SH prediction, while the same setup with Naive Bayes replacing random forest demonstrates better sensitivity. Our framework also provides interpretability of machine learning models by identifying key predictors for hypoglycemia, including fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, general diabetes education, and NPH or L insulins. The integration of data routinely available in electronic health records significantly enhances our model’s capability to predict SH events, showcasing its potential to transform clinical practice by facilitating early interventions and optimizing patient management. By enhancing prediction accuracy and identifying crucial predictive features, our study contributes to advancing the understanding and management of hypoglycemia in this population.

  title: Early-cycle prediction of battery aging onset across chemistries

  abstract: Accurately predicting the knee point cycle number, marking the onset of accelerated capacity degradation, is the first critical signal for managing lithium-ion battery life cycles in electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems. However, the inherent electrochemo-mechanical-thermal complexities of battery aging present significant challenges for physics-based models and machine-learning models, often leading to reduced predictive accuracy. Our study developed a comprehensive dataset comprising 20 lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NCM)/graphite cells (0.5–1 C) from our lab and 162 commercial lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite cells (3–6 C) from the public database, with knee point observed between 100 and 1000 cycles. We proposed a new strategy to extract novel features with strong physical context from early-cycle voltage curves, enabling precise knee point predictions across the chemistries without the need for extensive cycling histories. Our model achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7% for knee point prediction using five selected features. Remarkably, the model yielded 8% MAPE with only one single feature across the initial 200 cycles, and 10% MAPE when applying five features across the initial 50 cycles, spanning different battery chemistries. This work highlights the potential of integrating multi-chemistry datasets with data-driven modeling to forecast aging patterns across diverse battery chemistries, advancing battery longevity and reliability.
